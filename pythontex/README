:Requirements:  Python 2.7 or 3.2+; Pygments


The PythonTeX package allows you to enter Python code within a LaTeX document,
execute the code, and access its output in the original document.  It also
supports the Ruby, Julia, Octave, Sage, Bash, Rust, R, Perl, Perl 6, and
JavaScript languages.

PythonTeX provides fast, user-friendly access to Python from within LaTeX.
Python code is only executed when it has been modified, or when it meets
user-specified criteria.  Code may be divided into user-defined sessions,
which automatically run in parallel.  Errors and warnings are synchronized
with the LaTeX document, so that they refer to the document's line numbers.
External dependencies can be tracked, so that code is re-executed when the
data it depends on is modified.  PythonTeX also provides syntax highlighting
for code in LaTeX documents via the Pygments syntax highlighter.

PythonTeX includes a "depythontex" utility that creates a copy of a document
in which all Python code has been replaced by its output.  This can be
convenient for journal submissions, sharing documents, and converting to
other formats.

Consult pythontex_quickstart.pdf and pythontex_gallery.pdf to get
started and for examples of what PythonTeX can do.

Compiling a PythonTeX document involves three steps:

1. Run latex (all Python code is saved to an auxiliary file)
2. Run pythontex.py (all code is executed)
3. Run latex again (Python output is inputted)

See the main documentation in pythontex.pdf for detailed installation
instructions.  An installation script is provided for TeX Live and MiKTeX.
Files should be installed in the directories indicated below.  In summary,
all files must be installed, and symlinks or launching wrappers should be
created for pythontex.py and depythontex.py.
