PythonTeX depythontex script.

This script takes a LaTeX document that uses the PythonTeX package and 
creates a new document that does not depend on PythonTeX.  It substitutes all 
externally generated content into a copy of the original LaTeX document.  
This is useful when you need a document that relies on few external packages 
or custom macros (for example, for submission to a journal or conversion to 
another document format).

If you just want to share a document that uses PythonTeX, keep in mind that 
the document can be modified and compiled just like a regular LaTeX document, 
without needing Python or any other external tools, so long as the following 
conditions are met:

  * A copy of pythontex.sty is included with the document.
  * The pythontex-files-<name> directory is included with the document.
  * The PythonTeX-specific parts of the document are not modified.

To work, this script requires that the original LaTeX document be compiled 
with the package option `depythontex`.  That creates an auxiliary file with 
the extension .depytx that contains information about all content that needs
to be substituted.

This script is purposely written in a simple, largely linear form to 
facilitate customization.  Most of the key substitutions are performed by a 
few functions defined near the beginning of the script, so if you need custom
substitutions, you should begin there.  By default, all typeset code is 
wrapped in `\verb` commands and verbatim environments, since these have the 
greatest generality.  However, the command-line option --listing allows code 
to be typeset with the fancyvrb, listings, minted, or PythonTeX packages 
instead.

The script automatically extracts all arguments of all commands and 
environments that it replaces, so that these are available if desired for 
customized substitution.  Two additional pieces of information are also 
available for any typeset code:  the Pygments lexer (often the same as the 
language) and the starting line number (if line numbering was used).

Keep in mind that some manual adjustments may be required after a document is
depythontex'ed.  While depythontex attempts to create an exact copy of the 
original document, in many cases an identical copy is impossible.  For 
example, typeset code may have a different appearance or layout when it is 
typeset with a different package.

    Typeset code from a command with a command.
    
    It is only ever called if there is indeed code to typeset.
    
    Usually, code from a command is also typeset with a command.  This 
    function primarily deals with that case.  In cases where code from a 
    command is typeset with an environment (for example, `\inputpygments`),
    this function performs some preprocessing and then uses 
    replace_code_env() to do the real work.  This approach prevents the two
    functions from unnecessarily duplicating each other, while still giving
    the desired output.
    
    Args:
        name (str):  name of the command
        arglist (list, of str/None):  all arguments given to the original

        linenum (int):  line number in the original TeX document
        code_replacement (str/None):  replacement for the code; usually None

            last argument passed to the command, rather than something 
            captured elsewhere (like the body of an environment) or something
            preprocessed (like a console environment's content)

    Typeset printed content from an environment.
    
    It is only ever called if there is indeed printed content to typeset.
    
    This should be similar to replace_print_cmd().  The main difference is
    that the environment context typically ends with a newline, so 
    substitution has to be a little different to ensure that spacing after
    the environment isn't modified.
    
    Args:
        name (str):  name of the environment
        arglist (list, of str/None):  all arguments given to the original 
            environment
        linenum (int):  line number in the original TeX document where the 
            environment began
        print_replacement (str):  printed content, read directly from file
            into a single string
        print_replacement_mode (str/None):  mode in which the replacement is 
            to be typeset; raw/None (as TeX), inlineverb (or v) (as inline), 
            or verb (as environment)
        source (str/None):  source of the replacement content
        after (str):  text immediately following the command; important in
            some situations, because spacing can depend on what's next
    Returns:
        (replacement, after) (tuple, of str)
    
    #### The inlineverb and verb modes should work, but haven't been tested
    since there are currently no environments that use them; they are only
    used by `\printpythontex`, which is a command.
