Convert PythonTeX scripts from Python 2 to Python 3

It isn't possible to have a single PythonTeX code base, since unicode text 
needs to be supported.  Under Python 2, this means importing unicode_literals 
from __future__, or using the unicode function or "u" prefix.  Under Python 3,
all strings are automatically unicode.

At the same time, the differences between the Python 2 and 3 versions are 
usually very small, involving only a few lines of code.  To keep the code base
unified, while simultaneously fully supporting both Python 2 and 3, the 
following scheme was devised.  The code is written for Python 2.  Whenever 
code is not compatible with Python 3, it is enclosed with the tags 
"#// Python 2" and "#\\ End Python 2" (each on its own line, by itself).  If 
a Python 3 version of the code is needed, it is included between analogous 
tags "#// Python 3" and "#\\ End Python 2".  The Python 3 code is commented 
out with "#", at the same indentation level as the Python 3 tags.

This script creates Python 3 scripts from the original Python 2 scripts 
by commenting out everything between the Python 2 tags, and uncommenting 
everything between the Python 3 tags.  In this way, full compatibility is 
maintained with both Python 2 and 3 while keeping the code base essentially 
unified.  This approach also allows greater customization of version-specific 
code than would be possible if automatic translation with a tool like 2to3 
was required.
