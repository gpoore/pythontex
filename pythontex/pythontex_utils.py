PythonTeX utilities class for Python scripts.

The utilities class provides variables and methods for the individual 
Python scripts created and executed by PythonTeX.  An instance of the class 
named "pytex" is automatically created in each individual script.

        Create a context-aware interface to SymPy's LatexPrinter class.
        
        This is an interface to the LatexPrinter class, rather than 
        to the latex function, because the function is simply a 
        wrapper for accessing the class and because settings may be 
        passed to the class more easily.
        
        Context dependence is accomplished via LaTeX's \mathchoice macro.  
        This macros takes four arguments:
            \mathchoice{<display>}{<text>}{<script>}{<scriptscript>}
        All four arguments are typeset by LaTeX, and then the appropriate one 
        is actually typeset in the document based on the current style.  This 
        may seem like a very inefficient way of doing things, but this 
        approach is necessary because LaTeX doesn't know the math style at a 
        given point until after ALL mathematics have been typeset.  This is 
        because macros such as \over and \atop change the math style of things 
        that PRECEDE them.  See the following discussion for more information:
            http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1223/is-there-a-test-for-the-different-styles-inside-maths-mode
        
        The interface takes optional settings.  These optional 
        settings override the default context-dependent settings.  
        Accomplishing this mixture of settings requires (deep)copying 
        the default settings, then updating the copies with the optional 
        settings.  This leaves the default settings intact, with their 
        original values, for the next usage.
        
        The interface is created in various ways depending on the specific
        combination of context-specific settings.  While a general, static 
        interface could be created, that would involve invoking LatexPrinter 
        four times, once for each math style.  It would also require that 
        LaTeX process a \mathchoice macro for everything returned by 
        _sympy_latex(), which would add more inefficiency.  In practice, there 
        will generally be enough overlap between the different settings, and 
        the settings will be focused enough, that more efficient 
        implementations of _sympy_latex() are possible.
        
        Note that we perform a "lazy import" here.  We don't want to import
        the LatexPrinter unless we are sure to use it, since the import brings
        along a number of other dependencies from SymPy.  We don't want 
        unnecessary overhead from SymPy imports.
