This is the depythontex wrapper script.  It automatically detects the version
of Python, and then imports the correct code from depythontex2.py or 
depythontex3.py.  It is intended for use with the default Python installation 
on your system.  If you wish to use a different version of Python, you could 
launch depythontex2.py or depythontex3.py directly.  The version of Python
does not matter for depythontex, since no code is executed.
